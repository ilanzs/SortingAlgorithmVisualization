# SortingAlgorithmVisualization

A place for me to learn about sorting algorithms.

## Implemented sorting algorithms

### [Counting Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/counting-sort)

Counting Sort is a good algorithm for lists with small positive integers.
Speed: O(n+k)
n is number of elements in the array.
k is range of possible numbers in the array.

### [Bubble Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort)

Bubble Sort a simple inefficient sorting algorithms. Works with any float or integer
Speed: Speed: O(nÂ²)
n is number of elements in the array.

### [Bogo Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bogosort-permutation-sort)

Bogo Sort is made as a joke. It works by shuffling the list until it is sorted.
Speed: O((n-1)* n!)
n is number of elements in the array.
